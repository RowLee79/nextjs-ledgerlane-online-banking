# LedgerLane — Online Banking Simulation

A Next.js and Cloudflare D1 banking sandbox with fictional customers, demo accounts, internal transfers, deposits, withdrawals, beneficiaries, transaction entries, account statements and CSV export. Values are Philippine pesos stored as integer centavos. **This is not a real bank. Never use real customer data or money.**

Portfolio demonstration by RowLee Tanawan. The implementation uses Next.js-compatible App Router APIs with the Vinext runtime; deployment targets Cloudflare Workers. It is not a conventional standalone `next dev` deployment.

## Features

- The migration and transaction SQL were checked with an in-memory SQLite database for deposits, matching transfer ledger entries, exact balances and overdraft rejection. The private deployment succeeded with the migrated D1 tables.

## Technology

React, TypeScript, Next.js-compatible App Router, Vinext, Vite and responsive CSS. Cloudflare D1 SQLite and Drizzle migrations provide persistent data.

## Run locally

Node.js 22.13+ is required. Follow [installation, database initialization and walkthrough instructions](docs/SETUP.md), including the project-specific migration command. Dependencies and local database files are excluded from source control.

## Screenshots

Actual application screenshots are pending capture. No mockup is presented as a running application screenshot.
